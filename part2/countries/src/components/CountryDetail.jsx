  //  This is the useEffect hook. It is used to perform side effects in React components,
  //  such as fetching data from an external API. The useEffect hook runs the code inside 
  // it whenever the dependencies (in the second argument) change. Here, the dependencies 
  // are country.capital and apiKey.
  // Side effect: In this case, fetching the weather data for the capital of the country is a 
  // side effect that happens after the component renders. useEffect ensures the weather is 
  // fetched whenever the country.capital or apiKey changes. This is important because if 
  // we left it an emprty array, the weather data would only be fetched once when the component
  // first renders.

    // Instead of blocking the entire program until the operation is done (like in synchronous programming),
    // asynchronous functions allow other code to run while waiting for the operation to finish.

// HERE WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE USE EFFECT HOOK, CALLING THE FETCH WEATHER FUNCTION, AND PASSING THE DEPENDENCIES
// These are dependencies because: We want the weather data to be fetched whenever the capital city of the country changes.
//  If the capital changes, we need to make a new API call to get the updated weather for the new capital. 
// So, country.capital is a dependency because it triggers the effect whenever its value changes.
// If the apiKey changes (which might happen if you change the environment variable or your API key), you want to refetch 
// the weather data using the new key. So, apiKey is a dependency because any change to it should trigger the effect and the 
// associated API call.
